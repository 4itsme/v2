ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-\'Aĥzāb (The Combined Forces) - سورة الأحزاب <br> 33:36 <br> <b>وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ</b> لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا <br> <b>It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair.</b> And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error. <br> </font> <br> <br> 15.2 MALK(مَلْك): MILK(مِلك) is all that is in someone\'s hold and no other have any hold or authority over it .MALK and MILK both are similar in meaning relative to that in MALK authority in such a thing which is one\'s ownership and hold. and MALIK مَلِك is a king as public is in his hold and control and he is their manager. In the Quran.<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Ţāhā (Ta-Ha) - سورة طه <br> 20:87 <br> <b>قَالُوا مَا أَخْلَفْنَا مَوْعِدَكَ بِمَلْكِنَا</b> وَلَٰكِنَّا حُمِّلْنَا أَوْزَارًا مِّن زِينَةِ الْقَوْمِ فَقَذَفْنَاهَا فَكَذَٰلِكَ أَلْقَى السَّامِرِيُّ <br> <b>They said, "We did not break our promise to you by our will</b>, but we were made to carry burdens from the ornaments of the people [of Pharaoh], so we threw them [into the fire], and thus did the Samiri throw."</font> <br> <br> meaning samiri overpowered us by taking jewellery from us with deception and made a calf out of it.such that we lost authority and control over our own will and wish. <br> <br> <b>15.3 WALAYAH(وَلَاية)</b>: If WAW is Maftooh . and if WAW is maksoor that is WILAYAH(وِلايَة) then it means country ,kingdom, or kingship. and WALAYAH meaning to be trustee of some thing<br> and ALWALA-(الولاء) meaning that inheritance which is obtained of one\'s free slave. and WALAYAH is used in the Quran in the meaning of Inheritance. When First of the immigrants and Ansar establsihed brotherhood then they were also inheritors to each other but later on these commandments were revoked. and only real inheritors were delcared actual inheritors. (See Surah ANFAAL 72-75). Also Quran used MAWLA مولي (plural MAWALY موالي) in meaning of inheritor.

And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate. And let him fear Allah , his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon. And do not be [too] weary to write it, whether it is small or large, for its [specified] term. That is more just in the sight of Allah and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you, except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves. For [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. And take witnesses when you conclude a contract. Let no scribe be harmed or any witness. For if you do so, indeed, it is [grave] disobedience in you. And fear Allah . And Allah teaches you. And Allah is Knowing of all things. <br> </font><br> and DAYN refers to all the responsibilites of the transaction. so this word is general than QARD and this can be taken for commercial objectives as well as for personal need. consider this example A) that a person has to pay people 5000 Rupees debt. and also need to take back 8000 Rupees credit . then he is MUDYUN مديون but not MAQROOZ مقروض .B) If that person has to give 8000 Rupees debt and to take back 5000 Rupees credit then he is MUDYUN as well as MAQROOZ. and If a person takes debt for personal needs from some one for a limited time and If he has accepted the responisbility of paying the debt on time then it is not QARD but DAYN. because wherever in the Quran , QARD is used it came along with HASANA. and once of the condition of QARD-E-HASNA قَرض حسنه is that <br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Baqarah (The Cow) - سورة البقرة <br> 2:280 <br> <b>وَإِن كَانَ ذُو عُسْرَةٍ فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ مَيْسَرَةٍ</b> ۚ وَأَن تَصَدَّقُوا خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ ۖ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ <br> <b>And if someone is in hardship, then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease</b>.

The Quran\'s Ayah mentioned below is used in this first meaning.3DL relates to apparent and abstract all matters. and this has much wider context than QIST.

If this word related to earth then it means to plough as it raises earth(land) . and normally this word is used to raise for winds and rivers. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Ar-Rūm (The Romans) - سورة الروم <br> 30:48 <br> <b>اللَّهُ الَّذِي يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَابًا فَيَبْسُطُهُ فِي السَّمَاءِ كَيْفَ يَشَاءُ وَيَجْعَلُهُ كِسَفًا</b> فَتَرَى الْوَدْقَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلَالِهِ ۖ فَإِذَا أَصَابَ بِهِ مَن يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ إِذَا هُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ <br> <b>It is Allah who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds and spread them in the sky however He wills, and He makes them fragments</b> so you see the rain emerge from within them.

If this word used relating to dead then it contains both the meaning. meaning to resurrect the dead and send them towards the \'Field of Gathering\' ميدانِ محشر for e.g.<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Ĥaj (The Pilgrimage) - سورة الحج <br> 22:7 </font><b><font color="Navy"><br> وَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ آتِيَةٌ لَّا رَيْبَ فِيهَا وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْعَثُ مَن فِي الْقُبُورِ <br> And [that they may know] that the Hour is coming - no doubt about it - and that Allah will resurrect those in the graves. </font></b><br> <br> then this word is also used to awake from sleep(only in the first meaning) .because sleep is also a light type of death.
