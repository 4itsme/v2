ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-\'A`rāf (The Heights) - سورة الأعراف <br> 7:168 <br> وَقَطَّعْنَاهُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ أُمَمًا ۖ مِّنْهُمُ الصَّالِحُونَ وَمِنْهُمْ دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ ۖ <b>وَبَلَوْنَاهُم بِالْحَسَنَاتِ وَالسَّيِّئَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</b> <br> And We divided them throughout the earth into nations. Of them some were righteous, and of them some were otherwise.<b> And We tested them with good [times] and bad that perhaps they would return [to obedience]. </b></font><br> <br> because trial is generally painful so the usage is more for evil for e.g.<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Baqarah (The Cow) - سورة البقرة <br> 2:155 <b><br> وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُم بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ الْخَوْفِ وَالْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَنفُسِ وَالثَّمَرَاتِ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ </b><b><br> And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient, </b><br> </font><br> and IBTALA (إِبتَلَى) means to make something upside down or to inspect by varying conditions. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-\'Insān (The Man) - سورة الانسان <br> 76:2 <b><br> إِنَّا خَلَقْنَا الْإِنسَانَ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ أَمْشَاجٍ نَّبْتَلِيهِ</b> فَجَعَلْنَاهُ سَمِيعًا بَصِيرًا <br> <b>Indeed, We created man from a sperm-drop mixture that We may try him</b>; and We made him hearing and seeing. </font><br> <br> then IBTALA-(إِبتَلاَ) is generally from a sudden accident. such an incident which other people can see .see the ayah below: <br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Baqarah (The Cow) - سورة البقرة <br> 2:124 <br> <b>وَإِذِ ابْتَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ رَبُّهُ بِكَلِمَاتٍ فَأَتَمَّهُنَّ ۖ</b> قَالَ إِنِّي جَاعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا ۖ قَالَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِي ۖ قَالَ لَا يَنَالُ عَهْدِي الظَّالِمِينَ <br> <b>And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham was tried by his Lord with commands and he fulfilled them</b>. [ Allah ] said, "Indeed, I will make you a leader for the people." [Abraham] said, "And of my descendants?" [ Allah ] said, "My covenant does not include the wrongdoers." </font><br> <br> it is clear that these matters were ,exile,leaving offspring in barren field helpless,to prepare for sacrificing son,to enter into fire etc etc. which all other people could have seen.<br> <br> <b> 10.3 FATANA(فَتَنَ)</b>: like IBTALA- it includes the hardship in trial . FATANA means to put gold or silver in a furnace ,heat it ,melt it and find out its impurities. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Adh-Dhāriyāt (The Winnowing Winds) - سورة الذاريات <br> 51:13 <b><br> يَوْمَ هُمْ عَلَى النَّارِ يُفْتَنُونَ </b><b><br> [It is] the Day they will be tormented over the Fire </b></font><br> <br> and word FITNAH(فِتنَة) is mostly used for bad meaning. FITNAH means trial,sadness,grief,<wbr>embarrasment,delirious,warning ,punishment and disease. likewise FATTAN(فَتَّان) means evil person,thief,devil .although in IBTALA- trial on a human is not because of personal sins or wickedness. Period of Ibtala- and Period of FATAN difference is obvious. In Ibtala- the bad aspect is related to natural disasters wheras in FITNAH the bad aspect is mostly self created by human (individually). ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-\'Anfāl (The Spoils of War) - سورة الأنفال <br> 8:73 <br> وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ ۚ<b> إِلَّا تَفْعَلُوهُ تَكُن فِتْنَةٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَفَسَادٌ كَبِيرٌ</b> <br> And those who disbelieved are allies of one another.<b> If you do not do so, there will be fitnah on earth and great corruption. </b></font><br> <br> the most prominent difference between IBATALA- and FITNAH is that in FITNAH trial is normally of those things which a person love and are near to one\'s heart. Thus this Ayah of Holy Quran<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-\'Anfāl (The Spoils of War) - سورة الأنفال <br> 8:28 <b><br> وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ </b><b><br> And know that your properties and your children are but a trial and that Allah has with Him a great reward. </b></font><br> <br> is a powerful proof. in Surat Al-Baqarah ,the narrative of haroot and maroot, ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Baqarah (The Cow) - سورة البقرة <br> 2:102 <br> وَاتَّبَعُوا مَا تَتْلُو الشَّيَاطِينُ عَلَىٰ مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَانَ ۖ وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَانُ وَلَٰكِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ كَفَرُوا يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ السِّحْرَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَارُوتَ وَمَارُوتَ ۚ<b> وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلَا تَكْفُرْ</b> ۖ فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ ۚ وَمَا هُم بِضَارِّينَ بِهِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ ۚ وَلَقَدْ عَلِمُوا لَمَنِ اشْتَرَاهُ مَا لَهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَاقٍ ۚ وَلَبِئْسَ مَا شَرَوْا بِهِ أَنفُسَهُمْ ۚ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ <br> And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. <b>But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, "We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].</b>" And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah . And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew. <br> <br> <font color="Black">and this disbelief was study of magic, in craving of which those people were arrested/involved. This craving is refered to as FITNAH</font><br> </font> <br> <br> <b>Summary: </b><br> 10.1 IMTAHAN: In this trial there is ease instead of hardship and in that trial ,previous training and education is tested<br> 10.2 BALA- &amp; IBTALA:This a severe trial and generally of those occurences which others can also see meaning accidents<br> 10.3 FITNAH: in it of itself severe ,but alluring. meaning generally with those things which are near to a person\'s heart.

World of BARZAKH is like this that for Momin(Believer) it\'s comfort/relief and for disbeliever it\'s the begining of punishment, but this relief/punishment is of lesser magnitude than that of the Hereafter<br> and middle BARZAKH between two rivers is like that in one ocean there is warm tidal current and on the other there is cold tidal current then water of that BARZAKH will be moderate. likewise if one side is freshwater and the other saline and bitter then BARZAKH of this water will be of intermediate state and more examples of this BARZAKH can be given which contains moderate/intermediate types of attributes for e.g between Heaven and Earth (AARAF اعرََاف<br> ) where there will be neither Punishment nor Pleasure.

'content/A/A8.html': '<br><b>8 AZAD[FREE]<br> <br> Synonyms: HURR,MUHSIN,SUDE<br> <br> 8.1 HURR(حرّ)</b>: meaning free (antonym ABD عبد meaning slave) meaning a person who is no one\'s slave. in the Holy Quran.<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Baqarah (The Cow) - سورة البقرة <br> 2:178 <br> يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الْقِصَاصُ فِي الْقَتْلَى ۖ <b>الْحُرُّ بِالْحُرِّ وَالْعَبْدُ بِالْعَبْدِ وَالْأُنثَىٰ بِالْأُنثَىٰ ۚ</b> فَمَنْ عُفِيَ لَهُ مِنْ أَخِيهِ شَيْءٌ فَاتِّبَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَأَدَاءٌ إِلَيْهِ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ تَخْفِيفٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۗ فَمَنِ اعْتَدَىٰ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَهُ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ <br> O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered -<b> the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.</b> But whoever overlooks from his brother anything, then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct.

But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment. </font><br> <br> <br> <b>8.2 MUHSIN( مُحصِن)</b>: HASANA(حَصَنَ) meaning castle or shelter. and as per ibn al faris it comprise of three things a) protection b) encircled c) refuge and in AHSAN(أَحصَان) also these basic connotations are found. AHSAN is of two types 1) Freedom and it\'s prestige is like a castle itself compared with salvery, 2) It also serves as a castle in Nikah (marriage) to prevent shamelessness. and protect the chastity and dignity. in the Holy Quran this word is used in both the context. MUSHIN or MUHSINAT if comes in the meaning of 3AFIFI (عَفِيف) [chastity]]or 3AFIFAH(عَفِيفَه) then (ص) can be read with either Fathah or Kusrah. and if it comes after the word of HURRIMAT(حُرِّمَت) then (ص) can be read with Fathah whihc means only \'married\'. Free man and woman are quite free to protect their dignity as compared to slave man and woman. 1) because slaves have to out to sort out chores and being of low status in the society they commit or prone to shamelessness. 2) because at that time it was common for a master to prostitue his slaves woman out of greed. Thus ALLAH has strongly forbid from this heinous business. ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat An-Nūr (The Light) - سورة النور <br> 24:33 <br> وَلْيَسْتَعْفِفِ الَّذِينَ لَا يَجِدُونَ نِكَاحًا حَتَّىٰ يُغْنِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ ۗ وَالَّذِينَ يَبْتَغُونَ الْكِتَابَ مِمَّا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ فَكَاتِبُوهُمْ إِنْ عَلِمْتُمْ فِيهِمْ خَيْرًا ۖ وَآتُوهُم مِّن مَّالِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي آتَاكُمْ ۚ <b>وَلَا تُكْرِهُوا فَتَيَاتِكُمْ عَلَى الْبِغَاءِ إِنْ أَرَدْنَ تَحَصُّنًا لِّتَبْتَغُوا عَرَضَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۚ</b> وَمَن يُكْرِههُّنَّ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ مِن بَعْدِ إِكْرَاهِهِنَّ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br> But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until Allah enriches them from His bounty.

[They should be] chaste, neither [of] those who commit unlawful intercourse randomly nor those who take [secret] lovers. But once they are sheltered in marriage, if they should commit adultery, then for them is half the punishment for free [unmarried] women. This [allowance] is for him among you who fears sin, but to be patient is better for you. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.</font> <br> <br> In this Ayah , word MUHSANAT(مُحصِنَت) is used for free and virgin woman. as married women have more opportunity of protecting their chastity .After marriage the fulfillment of sexual desire and Man\'s honour is like a strong castle defending woman against shamelessness. In the Ayah mentioned below word MUHSANAT only clarifies the meaning of \'married woman\'. <br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat An-Nisā\' (The Women) - سورة النساء <br> 4:24 <br> <b>وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ إِلَّا مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ</b> ۖ كِتَابَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ ۚ وَأُحِلَّ لَكُم مَّا وَرَاءَ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَن تَبْتَغُوا بِأَمْوَالِكُم مُّحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَافِحِينَ ۚ فَمَا اسْتَمْتَعْتُم بِهِ مِنْهُنَّ فَآتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ فَرِيضَةً ۚ وَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِيمَا تَرَاضَيْتُم بِهِ مِن بَعْدِ الْفَرِيضَةِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيمًا حَكِيمًا <br> <b>And [also prohibited to you are all] married women except those your right hands possess</b>.

Antonym of HURR is ABD meaning slave. and HARRARA(حَرَّرَ) TEHREERAN(تِحرِيراً) meaning to free a slave. so this word is specific for \'to free a slave\'.

And whoever does not find [one or cannot afford to buy one] - then [instead], a fast for two months consecutively, [seeking] acceptance of repentance from Allah . And Allah is ever Knowing and Wise. <br> </font><br> <b>9.2 TALAQ (طَلاَق)</b>: it\'s root is TA-LA-QA(طلق) refers to two connotation a) seclusion b) dispatch. so some living being who is in one control and care, to give up control of that being and to dispatch. this word is commonly used to free wife from the contract of marriage and parting.but it is not necessary that both the connotation exist at the same time . ALLAH said<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-Baqarah (The Cow) - سورة البقرة <br> 2:229 <br> <b>الطَّلَاقُ مَرَّتَانِ ۖ</b> فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُوا مِمَّا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئًا إِلَّا أَن يَخَافَا أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ ۖ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا افْتَدَتْ بِهِ ۗ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلَا تَعْتَدُوهَا ۚ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ <br> <b>Divorce is twice</b>. Then, either keep [her] in an acceptable manner or release [her] with good treatment. And it is not lawful for you to take anything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep [within] the limits of Allah . But if you fear that they will not keep [within] the limits of Allah , then there is no blame upon either of them concerning that by which she ransoms herself. These are the limits of Allah , so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah - it is those who are the wrongdoers. </font><br> <br> Now this is clear that in once or twice divorce there exist seclusion but not parting. likewise TALAQ is used to free a slave (but it\'s example is not in Quran) .so here is also present the condition of seclusion or giving up one\'s right but neither the despatch is needed nor conditioned. which means that in TALAQ the real condition is Seclusion. and condition of Dispatch is sometimes existent ,like in the third divorce this condition becomes mandatory , and sometimes non existent like in first and second divorce<br> <br> <br> <b>9.3 TASREEH(تَسرِيح)</b>: derived from SRH(سرح) which means "to take out cattle for grazing" and ISRAH(اسرح) meaning to send out camel or cattle to graze. later on it is meant for leaving cattle free for grazing in the pasture. as in the Holy Quran<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat An-Naĥl (The Bee) - سورة النحل <br> 16:6 <b><br> وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا جَمَالٌ حِينَ تُرِيحُونَ وَحِينَ تَسْرَحُونَ </b><b><br> And for you in them is [the enjoyment of] beauty when you bring them in [for the evening] and when you send them out [to pasture]. </b><br> </font><br> so TASREEH basic meaning is to regard ease in dispatch and in that enforcement of contract is not that strong as in the meaning of TALAQ. also TASREEH is of common usage whereas TALAQ is now nearly limited to woman. but TASREEH if relates to woman TASREEH ALMIRAH(تَسرِيح المِرَاة) then it means to divorce the woman and dispatch her in a polite manner.

But if you fear that they will not keep [within] the limits of Allah , then there is no blame upon either of them concerning that by which she ransoms herself. These are the limits of Allah , so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah - it is those who are the wrongdoers. </font><br> <br> at another place said:<br> <br> <font color="Navy">Surat Al-\'Aĥzāb (The Combined Forces) - سورة الأحزاب <br> 33:28 <b><br> يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ إِن كُنتُنَّ تُرِدْنَ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا وَزِينَتَهَا فَتَعَالَيْنَ أُمَتِّعْكُنَّ وَأُسَرِّحْكُنَّ سَرَاحًا جَمِيلًا </b><b><br> O Prophet, say to your wives, "If you should desire the worldly life and its adornment, then come, I will provide for you and give you a gracious release. </b><br> </font><b><br> Summary: </b><br> 9.1 TEHREER:word specific to free a slave<br> ALTALAQ and TASREEH both words are used for parting with woman or in common usage for divorce<br> 9.2 ALTALAQ: <b>seclusion</b> is mandatory and <b>dispatch</b> is partially conditioned<br> 9.3 TASREEH:<b>dispatch</b> is mandatory and keeping in view ease and comfort<br>',
